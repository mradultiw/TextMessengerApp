# TextMessengerApp
This is a one way text message android app, just a side project for fun ;-)
It sends sms to a new number or one from your contacts.
App is tested only on Indian Numbers with country code +91,thus making the contact number of total length 13(3+10).
Any international sms can be send under the upper limit of string length of length 13 (do padding with 0 in case of short).
